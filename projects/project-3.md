summary: A record database program I developed for ICS 212.
---

The record database program was a solo project I worked on in C as an assignment for ICS 212. This project was something worked on throughout the semester, implementing features one at a time. The record database is a program that holds records containing personal info. There are options to manipulate the database by adding, deleting, and modifying records, as well as other options to the user. From this project, I learned a lot about coding in C, as well as taking advantage of pseudocode, the inner workings of data, and a better understanding of other concepts such as file reading and writing. 

Here is an example of the program running:
