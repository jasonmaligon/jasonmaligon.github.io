summary: Basic race game project for ICS 111.
---


The race game was the first big project that I have worked on for the ICS 111 course and in my life. While sticking to the requirements of the project, I was able to let my creativity flow in order to create something of my own in a certain style of game. This game involves three characters consisiting of one controllable character. The goal of the game is to basically reach the finish line first. Once a character has reached the finish line, the game ends and the winner is displayed. From this project, I learned quite a bit of things like how much time and dedication it takes to create something you're satisfied with in the end. I also learned a few things for coding in Java. 

For this project, I was responsible for programming everything since this was a solo project. I started by implementing the graphics and adding whatever images I wanted to be in the game. I wanted my game to be visually pleasing since I believe that it is an important aspect in attracting people to your project in the future. Afterwards, I needed to get the basic movement and behaviors of the characters down, programming how fast they move across the screen. The most important part was programming the controls. The character could only move if the 'a' and 'd' keys were pressed alternatively. After all the necessary mechanics were implemented, all that had to be done were things like sound and other graphics. 

You can watch a sample of the game on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdjYUF58sPw).
